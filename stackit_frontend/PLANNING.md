# StackIt Frontend Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the step-by-step development of the StackIt Flutter frontend, adhering strictly to `stackit_frontend_context.md` and `stackit_context.md`. We will follow the repository pattern, use Provider for state management, Dio for API calls, and implement features prioritizing must-haves like authentication, question management, answers, and real-time updates. No hallucinated features; reference existing structures only.

## Dependencies
Update `pubspec.yaml` with:
- flutter
- dio
- provider
- socket_io_client
- shared_preferences
- flutter_quill
- go_router
- json_annotation
Dev dependencies: flutter_test, build_runner, json_serializable, flutter_lints

## Folder Structure
Follow exactly as in `stackit_frontend_context.md`:
- lib/main.dart
- lib/app.dart
- lib/config/
- lib/core/
- lib/data/
- lib/presentation/
- assets/

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration ✅
- ✅ Update pubspec.yaml with dependencies.
- ✅ Create lib/main.dart and lib/app.dart for app entry.
- ✅ Set up config/app_config.dart, theme.dart, constants.dart.
- ✅ Configure core/network/api_client.dart, api_endpoints.dart.
- ✅ Set up routing in presentation/routes/.

### Phase 2: Data Layer Implementation ✅
- ✅ Create models in data/models/ (user_model.dart, question_model.dart, etc.) with JSON serialization.
- ✅ Implement datasources in data/datasources/ for API calls using Dio.
- ✅ Create repositories in data/repositories/ following repository pattern with error handling.

### Phase 3: State Management and Providers ✅
- ✅ Implement providers in presentation/providers/ for auth, questions, answers, etc.
- ✅ Handle loading, error, success states.

### Phase 4: UI Screens and Widgets ✅
- ✅ Build authentication screens in presentation/screens/auth/.
- ✅ Implement home and question screens in presentation/screens/home/ and /question/.
- ✅ Create reusable widgets in presentation/widgets/ for questions, answers, tags, etc.
- ✅ Add rich text editor in widgets/editor/.
- ✅ Implement profile UI components and screens.
- ✅ Implement notification components.
- ✅ Implement navigation and integration.

### Phase 5: Real-time and Services ✅
- ✅ Set up core/services/socket_service.dart for Socket.io.
- ✅ Implement notification service.
- ✅ Integrate real-time updates in providers.

### Phase 6: Utilities and Error Handling
- Add utils in core/utils/ for validation, dates, helpers.
- Implement error handling consistently.

### Phase 7: Testing and Polish
- Add tests in test/.
- Run flutter analyze.
- Optimize performance (lazy loading, const constructors).

## Priorities
- Must-haves: Auth, Questions, Answers, Tags, Notifications, Search/Pagination.
- Should-haves: Real-time, Profiles.
- Follow Material Design, responsive UI.

## Guidelines
- Reference Cursor Rules: No hallucination, use MCP tools if needed (e.g., sequential-thinking for complex parts).
- Commit changes with descriptive messages.
- Test each phase.

## Progress
- ✅ Phase 1-3 complete
- ✅ Phase 4 complete
  - ✅ Authentication UI completed (login, register, forgot password)
  - ✅ Home screen with bottom navigation completed
  - ✅ Question list, search, and notification screens implemented
  - ✅ Question detail, ask question, and edit question screens implemented
  - ✅ Answer components (list, form, card) and voting functionality
  - ✅ Common widgets created (loading, error, empty states)
  - ✅ Finished remaining UI components and rich text editor
  - ✅ Profile UI components and screens implemented
  - ✅ Notification components implemented (badge, card, list)
  - ✅ Navigation and integration completed with route guards
- 🔄 Phase 5 in progress
  - 🔄 Setting up real-time communication with Socket.io
This plan ensures accurate, perfect implementation aligned with context.
