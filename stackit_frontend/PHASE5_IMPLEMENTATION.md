# StackIt Frontend - Phase 5 Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of Phase 5 (Real-time and Services) of the StackIt Frontend development project. We will focus on implementing real-time communication using Socket.io and setting up notification services according to the structure defined in `stackit_frontend_context.md`.

## Implementation Approach
We'll implement real-time features in a logical order, starting with the foundation (Socket service), followed by notification service, and then integrating real-time updates across question and answer components. Each task will include necessary service creation and integration with existing providers.

## Tasks Breakdown

### 1. Socket Service Implementation
- [x] 1.1. Create socket_service.dart with Socket.io client configuration
- [x] 1.2. Implement connection management (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- [x] 1.3. Create event listeners and emitters
- [x] 1.4. Add authentication integration with socket connections
- [x] 1.5. Implement error handling and connection state management

### 2. Notification Service Implementation
- [x] 2.1. Complete notification_service.dart implementation
- [x] 2.2. Add methods for fetching notifications history
- [x] 2.3. Create real-time notification reception
- [x] 2.4. Implement notification read/unread functionality
- [x] 2.5. Add local notification storage with shared_preferences

### 3. Question Real-time Updates
- [x] 3.1. Update question_provider.dart to handle real-time events
- [x] 3.2. Implement new question notifications
- [x] 3.3. Add question update/edit real-time functionality
- [x] 3.4. Create vote count live updates
- [x] 3.5. Implement tag updates in real-time

### 4. Answer Real-time Updates
- [x] 4.1. Update answer_provider.dart for real-time functionality
- [x] 4.2. Implement new answer notifications
- [x] 4.3. Add answer update/edit real-time updates
- [x] 4.4. Create answer vote count live updates
- [x] 4.5. Implement answer acceptance real-time notification

### 5. User Presence and Activity
- [ ] 5.1. Add online status tracking
- [ ] 5.2. Implement typing indicators for answers/comments
- [ ] 5.3. Create user activity notifications
- [ ] 5.4. Add real-time user reputation updates

### 6. Integration and Testing
- [ ] 6.1. Connect socket events to UI components
- [ ] 6.2. Add visual indicators for real-time updates
- [ ] 6.3. Implement offline mode fallbacks
- [ ] 6.4. Test socket reconnection scenarios
- [ ] 6.5. Verify notification delivery and display

## Progress Tracking
- Start Date: Current Date
- Target Completion: Target Date
- Current Task: Socket Service Implementation (1.1)

## Implementation Notes
- Follow singleton pattern for socket and notification services
- Use provider to broadcast real-time updates to UI
- Handle poor network conditions gracefully
- Ensure proper socket authentication with JWT tokens
- Implement proper cleanup and disposal of socket connections
- Design battery-efficient socket usage patterns
- Consider application state (foreground/background) for socket behavior

## Technical Considerations

### Socket.io Implementation Best Practices
- Use socket namespaces for different feature domains (questions, answers, notifications)
- Implement proper reconnection strategy with exponential backoff
- Set appropriate timeouts and heartbeat intervals
- Handle authentication expiration and token refresh

### Notification Architecture
- Create a notification center for centralized notification management
- Design notification grouping for improved user experience
- Implement priority levels for different notification types
- Add silent vs. alert notification distinction

### Real-time Data Sync Strategy
- Implement optimistic UI updates before server confirmation
- Design conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Create diffing algorithm to minimize data transfer
- Implement efficient caching strategy for offline access

### Progress Indicators
- Add subtle visual indicators for real-time data changes
- Implement typing indicators where appropriate
- Show connection status indicators
- Display "last updated" timestamps

## Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 5)
- Push notifications integration
- Background sync capabilities
- Offline-first architecture improvements
- Enhanced presence features (user status, activity)

## Upcoming Tasks
After completing Phase 5, proceed with Phase 6: Utilities and Error Handling.
